# Sbanken Sensor Platform for Home Assistant

This sensor platform uses the open API of the norwegian bank Sbanken. 

Every account the customer has in the bank is created as sensor, and updated every 20 minutes.

## Installation

To get started download
```
/custom_components/sbanken/__init__.py
/custom_components/sbanken/sensor.py
```
into
```
<config directory>/custom_components/sbanken/
```

Restart your Home Assistant instance to load the component.

## Configuration

1. Start by signing up for the [Sbanken API program](https://sbanken.no/bruke/utviklerportalen/). This is free and the only requirement is that you are over 18.
2. Create an app in the developer portal. Store your Client ID somewhere and create a new password (secret).
3. Configure the sensor in Home Assistant.

```yaml
sensor:
    - platform: sbanken
      customer_id: 01010012345
      client_id: yourClientId
      secret: yourSecret
```

That's it! You can now use your brand new Sbanken sensor.
